		<h1> "About Me"</h1><!-- headline 1-->

		<p>	I am 23 years old and a junior here at NEIU. <b>My major is computer science with the emphasis of information technology</b>. 
		I transferred from Northern Illinois University last fall semester. I did this because I wanted to move back to Chicago. I believe a change in
		my surroundings was needed for me to finish my bachelors degree. I am currently taking client side web development to learn how to create websites 
		and also satisfy the department's requirements. Please refer to <a href="mytemplate.html">my template</a> for an example of me using cascading style sheets on tables.</p><br/>	
		<br/>
		<p><q><!-- q means quotes--> Perseverance </q>. Upon reading, this twelve letter word seems like a long word. Unfortunately for some, the time needed to accomplish a goal will take even longer than this word.	
		Sometimes things don't always come as quickly as we might want them to. This is when we are tested and only those who can persevere shall come out victorious. For example, I am starting here at NEIU
		with a totally new graduation date. If I stayed at NIU, I would have been scheduled to graduate earlier than I am now. However, I do question if I would have been as focused as I am now.
