/*N.B. For extra credit (5 pts.), after reading the article on how to make an awful web page, create a web page with a Sweetest Day theme utilizing as many "awful" 
web page techniques as possible, and add it to your Project I personal web site. You will need to make sure you can access the page from all of your navigation structures, 
including your site map. Also, make sure you use html comments to explain your "bad techniques" within the html file to receive credit. 
Note: Page is due by Sweetest Day (10.19.13).
